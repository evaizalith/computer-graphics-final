Eva Powlison CG Assignment 4

## Compiling

This program can be compiled using Make. The command `make run` will create a /build directory, compile the project, and run it. The command `make graphic` will build the project without running it. The compiled project will be saved to /build/graphic 

It can be manually compiled with the command `clang src/*.c -lGL -lglut -lGLU -lm -o build/graphic`. 

## Cool things in this project

- F8 to enable Gundam Mode
- I added a skybox that makes the scene look like it's happening at night under the stars
